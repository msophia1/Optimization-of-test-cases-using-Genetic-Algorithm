This application helps in reducing the time required to perform regression testing. 
It takes test cases from the user. Once the test cases are added, the tool then perform a sorting based on Genetic Algorithm which implies "Survival of the fittest" . 
The fitness of the testcases is evaluated using a fitness function.
The test cases which doesn't have a good fittess are eliminated and the test cases with good fitness is provided to the user
